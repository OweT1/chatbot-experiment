1. How will I be refunded if I paid by credit card instalment?
For orders paid via
credit card instalment
, your refund will be credited to your credit card within seven to fourteen working days, depending on the issuing bank. You will be able to view the amount on your monthly credit card billing statement.
If your refund is still being processed but your first instalment is due soon, you must pay it as scheduled. Once the refund process is complete, the amount paid for your first instalment will be refunded to your credit card.
If your refund amount is not reflected in your credit card statement within the same month as your Return/Refund request, it may appear on the next month's statement. For more details on the refund, you can contact your bank directly.
⚠️
Note
For orders with multiple products paid with credit card instalments, you can request a Return/Refund for one product only. Simply submit a Return/Refund request for the specific product. Shopee will consider the remaining products and adjust your monthly instalment amount accordingly.
2. How do I ensure that my refund will be processed to my ShopeePay account successfully?
To ensure that your refund will be processed successfully to your ShopeePay account:
1. Ensure your ShopeePay is activated
Your refund can only be processed with an activated ShopeePay account.
If you have not activated ShopeePay when the request is received, you will receive a notification for
ShopeePay activation
. If you do not activate it within 3 days, payment will be refunded directly to your bank account within 1-3 working days (excluding weekends and public holidays).
2. Check your ShopeePay balance limit
To ensure a successful refund, the sum of the refund amount and your current ShopeePay balance must not exceed your ShopeePay balance limit.
For verified accounts, ShopeePay allows a balance of up to SGD 5,000
For unverified accounts, ShopeePay allows a balance of up to SGD 1,000.
To increase your balance limit, you can
verify your ShopeePay

Alternatively, you can withdraw the funds to the bank account linked to your ShopeePay.
