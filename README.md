The code can be found in `main.ipynb`. Before using the code, we will need to do an installation of Ollama, as we are using the `mistral` model from Ollama.

Ollama can be installed over at [https://ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download).

After the installation of Ollama, you will need to do `ollama pull mistral` in the Command Prompt to install the model in order to use the model for QA.
